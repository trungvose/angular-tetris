## Why?

Tetris was the first game that my dad bought for me and It cost about 1$ US at that time. It didn't sound a lot today. But 20 years ago, 1$ can feed my family for at least a few days. Put it that way, with 1\$ you can buy two dozens eggs.
This is the only gaming "machine" that I ever had until my first computer arrived. I have never had a SNES or PS1 at home.

My Tetris was exactly in the same yellow color and it was so big, running on 2 AA battery. It is how it looks.

![Retro Tetris][tetris]

After showing my wife the [Tetris game built with Vue][vue]. She asked me why I didn't build the same <u>Tetris with Angular</u>? And here you go.

> The game can hold up to a maximum score of 999999 (one million minus one 😂) and I have never reached that very end.
>
> Please [tweet][tweetmax] the screenshot with your highest score, together with hashtag `#angulartetris` and my name tagged as well `@tuantrungvo`. I will send **a free gift** to the one having the highest score of the day, from now till <u>1 Aug 2020</u>.

## Who is this for?

I built this game dedicated to:

- For anyone that grew up with Tetris as a part of your memory. It was my childhood memory and I hope you enjoy the game as well.
- For the Angular developer community, I have never really seen a game that built with Angular and that's my answer. Using Akita as the underlying state management helps me to see all of the data flow, it is great for debugging. I wanted to see more Angular game from you guys 💪💪💪

## How to play

### Before playing

- You can use both keyboard and mouse to play. But prefer to use <u>keyboard</u>
- Press arrow left and right to change the speed of the game **(1 - 6)**. The higher the number, the faster the piece will fall
- Press arrow up and down to change how many of lines have been filled before starting the game **(1 - 10)**
- Press `Space` to start the game
- Press `P` for pause/resume game
- Press `R` for resetting the game
- Press `S` for the turn on/off the sounds

### Playing game

- Press `Space` make the piece drop quickly
- Press `Arrow left` and `right` for moving left and right
- Press `Arrow up` to rotate the piece
- Press `Arrow down` to move a piece faster
- When clearing lines, you will receive a point - 100 points for 1 line, 300 points for 2 lines, 700 points for 3 lines, 1500 points for 4 lines
- The drop speed of the pieces increases with the number of rows eliminated (one level up for every 20 lines cleared)

## Techstack

I built it barely with Angular and Akita, no additional UI framework/library was required.

![Angular Tetris][techstack]

## Development Challenge

I got the inspiration from the same but different [Tetris game built with Vue][vue]. To not reinvented the wheel, I started to look at Vue code and thought it would be very identical to Angular. But later on, I realized a few catches:

- The Vue source code was written a few years ago with pure JS. I could find several problems that the compiler didn't tell you. Such as giving `parseInt` a number. It is still working though, but I don't like it.
- There was extensive use of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for making animations. I rewrote all of the animation logic using RxJS. You will see the detail below.
- The brain of the game also used `setTimeout` for the game loop. It was not a problem, but I was having a <u>hard time</u> understanding the code on some essential elements: how to render the piece to the UI, how the calculation makes sense with XY axis. In the end, I changed all of the logic to a proper OOP way using TypeScript class, based on [@chrum/ngx-tetris][ngx-tetris].

### Tetris Core

It is the most important part of the game. As I am following the Vue source code, It is getting harder to understand what was the developer's intention. The Vue version inspired me but I think I have to write the core Tetris differently.

Take a look at the two blocks of code below which do the same rendering piece on the screen and you will understand what I am talking about. The left side was rewritten with Angular and TypeScript and the right side was the JS version.

![Angular Tetris][compare01]

I always think that your code must be written as you talk to people, without explaining a word. Otherwise, when someone comes in and reads your code and maintains it, they will be struggling.

> “ Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House

And let me emphasize it again, I didn't write the brain of the game from scratch. I adapted the well-written source by [@chrum/ngx-tetris][ngx-tetris] for Tetris core. I did refactor some parts to support Akita and wrote some new functionality as well.

### Akita state management + dev tool support

Although you don't dispatch any action, Akita will still do it undo the hood as the Update action. And you still can see the data with [Redux DevTools][redux-devtool]. Remember to put that option into your `AppModule`

```ts
imports: [environment.production ? [] : AkitaNgDevtools.forRoot()];
```

I turn it on all the time on [tetris.trungk18.com][angular-tetris], you can open the DevTools and start seeing the data flow.

![Angular Tetris][akita-devtool]

> Note: opening the DevTools could reduce the performance of the game significantly. I recommended you turn it off when you want to archive a high score 🤓

### Customizing Piece

I defined a base [Piece class][piece-class] for a piece. And for each type of piece, it will extend from the same base class to inherit the same capability

[piece-class]: src/app/interface/piece/piece.ts

```ts
export class Piece {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  rotation = PieceRotation.Deg0;
  type: PieceTypes;
  shape: Shape;
  next: Shape;

  private _shapes: Shapes;
  private _lastConfig: Partial<Piece>;

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  store(): Piece {
    this._lastConfig = {
      x: this.x,
      y: this.y,
      rotation: this.rotation,
      shape: this.shape
    };
    return this._newPiece();
  }

  //code removed for brevity
}
```

For example, I have a piece L. I create a new class name [PieceL][piecel]. I will contain the shape of L in four different rotation so that I don't have to mess up with the math to do minus plus on the XY axis. And I think defining in that way makes the code self-express better. If you see 1, it means on the matrix it will be filled, 0 mean empty tile.

If my team member needs to maintain the code, I hope he will understand what I was trying to write immediately. Or maybe not 🤣

One import property of the Piece is the `next` property to display the piece shape on the decoration box for the upcoming piece.

[piecel]: src/app/interface/piece/L.ts

```ts
const ShapesL: Shapes = [];
ShapesL[PieceRotation.Deg0] = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
];

ShapesL[PieceRotation.Deg90] = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0]
];
//code removed for brevity

export class PieceL extends Piece {
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    super(x, y);
    this.type = PieceTypes.L;
    this.next = [
      [0, 0, 1, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 0]
    ];
    this.setShapes(ShapesL);
  }
}
```

Now is the interesting part, you create a custom piece by yourself. Simply create a new class that extends from `Piece` with different rotations.

For instance, I will define a new piece call F with class name [`PieceF`][piecef]. That is how it should look like.

[piecef]: https://github.com/trungk18/angular-tetris/blob/feature/pieceF/src/app/interface/piece/F.ts

```ts
const ShapesF: Shapes = [];
ShapesF[PieceRotation.Deg0] = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
];

export class PieceF extends Piece {
  constructor(x, y) {
    super(x, y);
    this.type = PieceTypes.F;
    this.next = [
      [1, 0, 1, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 1]
    ];
    this.setShapes(ShapesF);
  }
}
```

And the last step, go to [PieceFactory][piecefactory] to add the new PieceF into the available pieces.

[piecefactory]: src/app/factory/piece-factory.ts

```ts
export class PieceFactory {
  private _available: typeof Piece[] = [];

  constructor() {
    //code removed for brevity
    this._available.push(PieceF);
  }
}
```

And you're all set, this is the result. See how easy it is to understand the code and add a custom piece that you like.

The source code for that custom piece F, you can see at [feature/pieceF][feature/piecef] branch.

[feature/piecef]: https://github.com/trungk18/angular-tetris/tree/feature/pieceF
[piecef-demo]: src/assets/readme/piecef-demo.gif

### Animation

I rewrote the animation with RxJS. See the comparison below for the simple dinosaurs running animation at the beginning of the game.

You could do a lot of stuff if you know RxJS well enough :) I think I need to strengthen my RxJS knowledge soon enough as well. Super powerful.

![Angular Tetris][compare02]

The actual result doesn't look very identical but it is good enough in my standard.

![Angular Tetris][compare02-result]

### Web Audio API

There are many sound effects in the game such as when you press space, or left, right. In reality, all of the sounds were a reference to a single file [assets/tetris-sound.mp3][sounds].

I don't have much experience working with audio before but the Web Audio API looks very promising. You could do more with it.

- See the [official documentation][webaudio]
- See how I load the mp3 file and store it in [sound-manager.service.ts][sound-manager]
- [Writing Web Audio API code that works in every browser][web_audio_api_cross_browser]

### Keyboard handling

I planned to use [@ngneat/hotkeys][hotkeys] but I decided to use `@HostListener` instead. A simple implementation could look like:

```typescript
@HostListener(`${KeyDown}.${TetrisKeyboard.Left}`)
keyDownLeft() {
  this._soundManager.move();
  this._keyboardService.setKeỵ({
    left: true
  });
  if (this.hasCurrent) {
    this._tetrisService.moveLeft();
  } else {
    this._tetrisService.decreaseLevel();
  }
}
```

## Time spending

I was still working with [Chau Tran][chautran] on phase two of [Angular Jira clone][jira-clone] when I saw that Tetris game built with Vue. My wife wanted to have a version that I built so that I decided to finish the Angular Tetris first before completing Jira clone phase two.

According to waka time report, I have spent about 30 hours working on this project. Which is equal to [run a marathon five times][marathon] at my current speed 😩

![Angular Tetris][timespending]

The flow was easy. I designed a simple [to do list][todolist], then start reading the code in Vue. And start working on the Angular at the same time. Halfway, I start to read [@chrum/ngx-tetris][ngx-tetris] instead of the Vue source. And keep building until I have the final result. 30 hours was a good number. It would take me longer, or lesser. But I enjoyed the experience working on the first-ever game I have built.
